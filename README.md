# Description

**eLabFTW** is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams. It also features a database where you can store any kind of objects (think antibodies, plasmids, cell lines, boxes, _etc_â€¦)
It is accessed _via_ the browser by the users. Several research teams can be hosted on the same install, so **eLabFTW** can be installed at the institute level and host everyone at the same place (this is what is done at [Institut Curie](http://www.curie.fr) and in several other research centers across the globe).

# **Open Sauce - eLabFTW Fork**

### [Share Your Sauce!](https://opensauce.us)


# Description

**OpenSauce.US** is a platform for collaborative experimental science. We aspire to be the world's largest repository of reproducible recipes. Our mission is to democratize innovation by lowering the barriers to reproducing experiments, syntheses, recipes, and fabrication processes. [Open Sauce](https://github.com/rawray7/open-sauce-license) means open source chemistry.

**eLabFTW** is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams. OpenSauce.US builds from this amazing tool, by flipping it inside out. Unlike a traditional electronic lab notebook, anyone can sign up for OpenSauce.US and start recording their experiments today. OpenSauce.US users can choose when and with whom to share their work.

# Principles

- Maximize reproducibility.
- Encourage attribution.
- Improve understanding.
- Preserve optionality.
- Prioritize safety.

# Documentation

<<<<<<< HEAD
**eLabFTW** is designed to be installed on a server, and people from the team would just log into it from their browser.
Don't have a server ? That's okay, you can use an old computer with 1 Go of RAM and an old CPU, it's more than enough. Just install a recent GNU/Linux distribution on it and plug it to the intranet.

# Installation

## The legendary three steps installation instructions (for advanced users)
* `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw`
* Create a MySQL database and a MySQL user for elabftw
* Go to https://your-address.org/elabftw/install

## The legendary documentation (for everyone else)
[Read the documentation, it's very complete](https://elabftw.readthedocs.org).
