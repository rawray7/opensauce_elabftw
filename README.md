### [Share Your Sauce!](https://opensauce.us)


# Description

**OpenSauce.US** is a platform for collaborative experimental science. We aspire to be the world's largest repository of reproducible recipes. Our mission is to democratize innovation by lowering the barriers to reproducing experiments, syntheses, recipes, and fabrication processes. [Open Sauce](https://github.com/rawray7/open-sauce-license) means open source chemistry.

**eLabFTW** is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams. OpenSauce.US builds from this amazing tool, by flipping it inside out. Unlike a traditional electronic lab notebook, anyone can sign up for OpenSauce.US and start recording their experiments today. OpenSauce.US users can choose when and with whom to share their work.
